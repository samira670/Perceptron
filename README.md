Iris Species Classification Using Perceptron
This script demonstrates using a Perceptron, a type of linear classifier, to classify iris species based on features such as sepal and petal dimensions. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, training, prediction, and evaluation.

Dependencies
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Features
Data Standardization: Utilizes StandardScaler to ensure features contribute equally to model training.
Model Training: Trains a Perceptron on the standardized training data.
Evaluation: Uses classification metrics to assess model accuracy.
